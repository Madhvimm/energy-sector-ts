    "text": "Time Series Plot\nIn this section, we delve into time series data, focusing on the energy sector’s economic impact. Time series analysis is pivotal in understanding the temporal patterns and trends within data points collected sequentially over time. By employing time series plots, we gain invaluable insights into the underlying structures of our datasets, such as trends, seasonality, and cyclical fluctuations.\nThe visualizations will present a detailed examination of several key data sets: Crude Oil Prices, Natural Gas Prices, Electricity Prices, GDP, and CPI. Each plot is designed to elucidate the temporal progression of these variables, providing a foundation for deeper analytical exploration. Through these visualizations, we aim to identify significant patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the data, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions about the economic interplay between energy prices and broader economic indicators.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series plot for crude oil showcases the historical refiner acquisition costs. Observations include a long-term upward trend, significant volatility, and notable peaks, particularly around 2008 and 2011 and 2015. The recent years exhibit a declining trend post the last peak, highlighting the dynamic nature of crude oil prices.\nTrend: Increasing over the long term with recent decline.\nSeasonality: No clear seasonality observed due to the dominant influence of geopolitical and economic factors on oil prices.\nNature of Series: The series seems to be multiplicative, given the percentage changes and volatility patterns.\n\n\n\n\nPlot Natural Gas Prices\n# Plotting with ggplot2\np_citygate_gas &lt;- ggplot(citygate_gas_prices, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line() + # Add a line geometry\n  theme_minimal() + # Use a minimal theme for a cleaner look\n  labs(title = \"Natural Gas Price Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Price (USD)\")\n\n# Convert ggplot object to plotly for interactivity\nggplotly(p_citygate_gas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural gas price graph, reveals substantial fluctuations, a significant peaks in 2001, 2005, 2008 and around 2021, and recent volatile trends. Unlike crude oil, natural gas prices do not exhibit a clear long-term trend but return closer to the baseline after peaks.\nTrend: Fluctuating without a clear long-term direction.\nSeasonality: Less evident due to the market’s response to short-term supply and demand changes.\nNature of Series: Likely multiplicative, reflecting the proportional changes and variability in prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Average Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers” graph offers insights into the pricing trends of electricity, an essential commodity for consumers and industries alike.\nTrend: There is a upward trend showcasing long-term growth.\nSeasonality: Periodic oscillations in price could signify seasonal demand changes, driven by heating needs in winter or cooling in summer, impacting production costs and consumption patterns.\nNature of Series: Likely additive, characterized by a regular oscillations indicating seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP growth exhibits an overall upward trend with a notable dip in 2020, possibly due to economic downturns because of the pandemic. The recovery post-dip indicates economic resilience.\nTrend: Increasing with acceleration in recent decades.\nSeasonality: Not applicable for GDP as it reflects economic trends and we cant see in the graph as well.\nNature of Series: Additive, considering the steady growth pattern with occasional dips and recoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI graph illustrates a continuous upward trend, indicative of inflation. Recent increases suggest a period of higher inflation, potentially influenced by various economic factors.\nTrend: Consistently upward, indicating inflation.\nSeasonality: Not distinctly observable, as CPI reflects broader economic price changes\nNature of Series: Additive, with a steady increase in consumer prices over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLag Plots\nLag plots are essential tools in time series analysis, offering insights into the temporal dependency within the data. By comparing data points with their previous values (lags), we can uncover patterns, trends, and potential autocorrelation in the series. Each lag in the plot helps us to visualize how past values relate to current values, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics and forecasting future trends. In this section, we explore lag plots for various key economic indicators and energy prices, providing a deeper understanding of their time-dependent structures.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots for the Cost of Crude Oil reveal a positive autocorrelation. The presence of color-coded months suggests seasonal trends, though they are not starkly evident. As lags increase, the correlation weakens, diminishing predictive power over longer time lags.\n\nPositive Autocorrelation evident across the lags, suggesting that past prices influence future prices.\nThe strength of autocorrelation decreases with higher lags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas Price lag plots display a positive autocorrelation, especially evident in the initial lags. With increasing lags, the data points become more dispersed, indicating a reduction in autocorrelation strength.\n\nStrong Autocorrelation in the initial lags, indicating past prices are good predictors for the near future.\nAs the lag increases, the correlation diminishes, which is common in time series data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity price lag plots show a strong and consistent positive autocorrelation across all lags, suggesting stable and predictable price trends. The seasonal effect is visible, with certain months consistently clustering together.\n\nStrong positive auto-correlation is maintained across various lags.\nClear month-to-month price consistency suggests significant seasonality.\nThe strong correlation at higher lags implies underlying factors affecting electricity prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP’s lag plots exhibit a very strong linear relationship across all lags, reflecting the steady economic growth.\n\nPersistent growth indicates steady economic progression.\nNo distinct seasonal patterns are visible, suggesting uniform economic growth across quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI lag plots show a strong positive autocorrelation, indicating consistent inflation trends.\n\nReflects a steady inflation rate over the years.\nThe consistent distribution of quarterly colors across lags indicates an even inflation rate across all months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plots\nDecomposition plots are powerful tools in time series analysis, allowing us to dissect a series into its core components: trend, seasonality, and irregular (residual) components. This breakdown provides a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and behaviors in the data. For instance, the trend component shows the long-term direction of the series, while the seasonal component highlights repeating patterns over fixed periods. The irregular component captures random fluctuations that are not part of the trend or seasonality. Here, we explore the decomposition plots for various key datasets, unveiling the distinct dynamics of each.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Cost of Crude Oil offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Shows an upward trend until 2008, with fluctuations until 2014, followed by a downward trend, illustrating the market’s long-term dynamics.\nSeasonal: Demonstrates annual seasonal patterns, highlighting how external factors influence oil prices.\nRemainder: The residuals are relatively stable around zero, suggesting a good model fit with some sporadic spikes in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Natural Gas Price offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Indicates a stable trend transitioning to volatility, reflecting the market’s evolving nature.\nSeasonal: Exhibits strong annual cycles, likely tied to demand changes with seasons\nRemainder: Spikes represent unexplained anomalies, possibly due to supply disruptions, especially around 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity price decomposition highlights the stable growth and seasonality in the market.\nTrend: Shows a consistent rise, pointing to factors like inflation or cost increases in production affecting prices.\nSeasonal: A clear pattern suggests predictable consumption changes, possibly due to heating and cooling needs.\nRemainder: Minimal and stable residuals with occasional unexplained fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP decomposition provides insights into economic growth patterns.\nTrend: Reflects steady economic growth with some acceleration, illustrating the economy’s long-term health.\nSeasonal: Negligible seasonality\nRemainder: Notable deviations, like the spike around 2020, could indicate economic shocks, such as the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI decomposition plot sheds light on inflation trends.\nTrend: The upward trend signifies ongoing inflation, a key economic indicator.\nSeasonal: Minimal seasonality.\nRemainder: Small residuals suggest the model captures CPI’s main trends, with occasional anomalies.\nFor all the data series examined, the decomposition plots provide a detailed confirmation of the preliminary insights highlighted in Part 1. These plots dissect the time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components, offering a more granular perspective that reinforces our initial analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF & PACF Plots\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are crucial tools in time series analysis, helping to identify the type of model that best describes a series. The ACF plot shows the correlation of the series with its own lags, providing insights into the overall correlation structure and potential seasonality. On the other hand, the PACF plot reveals the direct effect of past values on the current value, helping to pinpoint the order of autoregressive models.\nBy examining the ACF and PACF plots, we can discern patterns that suggest the presence of autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) components in our time series models. Significant spikes in the ACF plot indicate potential AR terms, while significant spikes in the PACF plot suggest MA terms. These plots also assist in determining the stationarity of the series, a crucial aspect in time series modeling, where non-stationary data often require differencing to achieve stationarity.\nIn this section, we’ll explore the ACF and PACF plots for our datasets delving into their autocorrelation structures and deriving insights that will inform our model selection and forecasting approach.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for crude oil prices demonstrates prolonged significant autocorrelation, suggesting a non-stationary series. The gradual decline in correlation as lags increase indicates a potential long-term dependency or trend in the data.\nThe PACF plot shows significant spike at lag 1 and 2, followed by non-significant values\nThe ACF and PACF plots suggest considering an ARIMA model with ‘p’ to be 1 and 2. The slow decay in the ACF implies that differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for natural gas prices shows a very slow decay, suggesting non-stationarity and a need for differencing.\nThe PACF plot shows a significant spike at lag 1, followed by a drop-off.\nThe ACF and PACF plots suggest considering an ARIMA model with ‘p’ to be 1 and 2. The slow decay in the ACF implies that differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for electricity shows a strong positive autocorrelation across all the lags indicating a potential MA term and a need for differencing due to non-stationarity.\nThe PACF plot shows a significant correlations at lag 1. The choice of ‘p’ could be 1 or 2 based on the first significant spikes.\nThe consistent autocorrelation in the ACF plot suggests a potential need for a higher-order MA term or differencing, leading to an ARIMA(p,d,q) model consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for GDP shows a persistent strong autocorrelation across all lags indicates non-stationarity, suggesting that differencing may be necessary.\nThe PACF plot have a sharp cutoff after lag 1 indicating an AR(1) process, suggesting that previous values have a significant impact on current GDP.\nGiven the strong autocorrelation and the PACF cutoff, an ARIMA(1,1,0) model may be a good starting point for modeling GDP, but differencing (d &gt; 0) may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for CPI shows a sustained high autocorrelation across lags suggests a non-stationary time series, indicative of CPI’s long memory.\nThe PACF plot have a sharp spike and a cutoff after lag 1 indicating an AR(1) process, suggesting that previous values have a significant impact on current GDP.\nThe sustained autocorrelation in the ACF plot implies that differencing might be needed. An initial ARIMA(1,1,0) model could be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller Test\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical test used to determine the presence of unit root in a time series and, consequently, whether the series is non-stationary. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non-stationary. If the p-value is less than the chosen alpha level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and infer that the series is stationary.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  composite_crude_oil_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8866, Lag order = 8, p-value = 0.203\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nSince the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the crude oil price series is non-stationary, indicating that differencing or transformation may be required to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  citygate_gas_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8807, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.2055\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe p-value suggests that the natural gas price series is non-stationary, reinforcing the need for potential differencing or other transformations to stabilize the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  total_electricity_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.2818, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.459\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWith the p-value well above 0.05, the electricity price series is considered non-stationary, indicating that adjustments are necessary to model the series accurately.\n\n\n\n\nWarning in tseries::adf.test(gdp_ts): p-value greater than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  gdp_ts\nDickey-Fuller = 2.5163, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.99\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe extremely high p-value indicates that the GDP series is strongly non-stationary, suggesting that it would benefit from differencing or other methods to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  cpi_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -0.76835, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.9644\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe CPI series is also non-stationary based on the high p-value, indicating that preprocessing steps are needed before further analysis or modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Dickey-Fuller test results across different datasets corroborate our earlier analyses and ACF & PACF plot interpretations, showing a common theme of non-stationarity in the series.\n\n\nDetrend VS Difference\nDetrending and differencing are two methods used to make time series data stationary, it involves removing the underlying trend from the data, while differencing focuses on the changes between consecutive observations.\nDetrending typically subtracts the estimated trend component from the original series, while differencing transforms the series into the sequence of differences between adjacent values. While detrending addresses the trend, differencing can help eliminate both trend and seasonality, making the series stationary.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe residuals after detrending indicate that linear detrending might not fully account for all underlying components, as patterns still emerge.\nFirst Difference:\nThe differenced series shows fluctuations around zero, indicative of improved stationarity. While the mean appears stabilized, examining autocorrelation in the differenced data is crucial to confirm stationarity fully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe detrended series shows periods of volatility, indicating that removing the linear trend doesn’t capture all the data’s dynamics, remaining fluctuations may reflect other underlying components like seasonality\nFirst Difference:\nConsistent mean but varying volatility and a spike around 2020, which could be due to the pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe detrended plot of electricity prices displays clear periodic fluctuations, suggesting the presence of seasonality.\nFirst Difference:\nThe first differenced series oscillates around a central mean, which is indicative of stationarity in the mean of the series. However, the consistent pattern of spikes followed by a return to the mean—indicates a strong seasonal component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe detrended GDP plot showcases that the residuals seem to have a non-linear component, as evidenced by the gradual decline and subsequent increase over time. The residuals decrease and then slowly begin to rise after the 1980s, accelerating significantly in recent years. GDP growth rate is not constant and a simple linear model may not be sufficient to capture the complexities.\nFirst Difference:\nThe differenced series predominantly hovers around the zero line, which indicates that this transformation effectively removes the trend from the data, leading to a stationary series in terms of the mean. The substantial spike observed towards the end is likely due to the recent economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a significant economic shock not accounted for by typical GDP growth patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe detrended CPI plot reveals residuals that decline over a prolonged period before stabilizing and then increasing. This pattern suggests that a simple linear trend does not fully capture the complexity of the inflationary trend over time.\nFirst Difference:\nThe first difference plot for CPI demonstrates a series that fluctuates around a central mean value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving Average Smoothing\nMoving average smoothing is a time series forecasting method that can help identify long-term trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. By averaging the data over specific time windows, these methods filter out the ‘noise’ and offer a cleaner view of the direction in which the series is moving.\nIn our analysis, we employ moving averages as a means to discern and illustrate trends within the energy sector’s economic data. By choosing different window lengths for our moving averages, we can examine trends on various time scales:\nShort-Term Trends: A 5-period moving average (5-MA) can reveal insights into the short-term direction of the data, helping us to understand recent movements and immediate market responses.\nMedium-Term Trends: A 15-period moving average (15-MA) extends the horizon, smoothing out month-to-month volatility to focus on the quarterly or seasonal patterns.\nLong-Term Trends: With 20- and 30-period moving averages (20-MA and 30-MA), we delve into the long-term movements that reflect overarching trends and economic cycles.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI"

This method is effective in eliminating both trend and seasonality, transforming the series into one where the mean level does not change over time. Differencing is a critical step in preparing data for ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickey-Fuller Test\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is a statistical test used to determine the presence of unit root in a time series and, consequently, whether the series is non-stationary. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non-stationary. If the p-value is less than the chosen alpha level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and infer that the series is stationary.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  composite_crude_oil_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8866, Lag order = 8, p-value = 0.203\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nSince the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the crude oil price series is non-stationary, indicating that differencing or transformation may be required to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  citygate_gas_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.8807, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.2055\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe p-value suggests that the natural gas price series is non-stationary, reinforcing the need for potential differencing or other transformations to stabilize the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  total_electricity_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.2818, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.459\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nWith the p-value well above 0.05, the electricity price series is considered non-stationary, indicating that adjustments are necessary to model the series accurately.\n\n\n\n\nWarning in tseries::adf.test(gdp_ts): p-value greater than printed p-value\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  gdp_ts\nDickey-Fuller = 2.5163, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.99\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe extremely high p-value indicates that the GDP series is strongly non-stationary, suggesting that it would benefit from differencing or other methods to achieve stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  cpi_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -0.76835, Lag order = 9, p-value = 0.9644\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe CPI series is also non-stationary based on the high p-value, indicating that preprocessing steps are needed before further analysis or modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Dickey-Fuller test results across different datasets corroborate our earlier analyses and ACF & PACF plot interpretations, showing a common theme of non-stationarity in the series.\n\n\nFirst vs Second Differencing\nIn time series analysis, differencing is a technique used to stabilize the mean of a series and make it stationary. When trends and seasonality are present in a time series, they can affect the predictive models. Differencing helps to mitigate these influences by focusing on the changes in the data rather than the actual values.\nDifferencing operates under the principle of transformation. It is designed to remove specific types of patterns:\n\nFirst Differencing: This method subtracts the current observation from the previous one. It is a powerful tool to eliminate trends and some types of seasonality in the data, providing a clearer view of the underlying cyclical components and irregularities.\nSecond Differencing: When first differencing is not enough to achieve stationarity, or when the time series exhibits a more complex pattern such as a trend within a trend, second differencing can be employed. This involves applying the differencing operation twice, which can further simplify the predictive structure by reducing more complex serial correlations.\n\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC & BIC\nIn time series analysis, choosing the right model is paramount for accurate forecasting. Two of the most critical metrics for model selection are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Both criteria are grounded in information theory and provide a means to balance model fit with model complexity.\n\nAIC is a tool for model selection that quantifies the trade-offs between model complexity (the number of parameters in the model) and the goodness of fit. AIC rewards models that achieve a high goodness of fit but penalizes those that become overly complex. A lower AIC value often indicates a preferable model.\nBIC extends the logic of AIC by incorporating sample size into the penalty for complexity. This adjustment makes BIC more stringent with complex models when dealing with larger datasets. As with AIC, a lower BIC suggests a better model.\n\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\n   p d q      AIC      BIC     AICc\n24 4 1 3 3090.304 3129.861 3090.609\n\n\n   p d q      AIC      BIC     AICc\n24 4 1 3 3090.304 3129.861 3090.609\n\n\n   p d q      AIC      BIC     AICc\n12 2 1 1 3095.071 3117.047 3095.172\n\n\n   p d q      AIC      BIC     AICc\n24 4 1 3 3090.304 3129.861 3090.609\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   p d q      AIC     BIC     AICc\n17 3 1 1 1031.985 1057.04 1032.162\n\n\n   p d q      AIC     BIC     AICc\n17 3 1 1 1031.985 1057.04 1032.162\n\n\n  p d q     AIC      BIC     AICc\n2 0 1 1 1037.54 1050.068 1037.591\n\n\n   p d q      AIC     BIC     AICc\n17 3 1 1 1031.985 1057.04 1032.162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   p d q      AIC       BIC      AICc\n20 3 1 4 -412.675 -374.8158 -412.3046\n\n\n   p d q      AIC       BIC      AICc\n20 3 1 4 -412.675 -374.8158 -412.3046\n\n\n   p d q       AIC       BIC      AICc\n23 4 1 2 -412.1291 -378.4765 -411.8334\n\n\n   p d q      AIC       BIC      AICc\n20 3 1 4 -412.675 -374.8158 -412.3046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n  p d q      AIC    BIC     AICc\n4 1 1 1 4033.393 4048.3 4033.525\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting ARIMA\nMoving average smoothing is a time series forecasting method that can help identify long-term trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations.

    "text": "“To truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy.” – Barack Obama\nIn an era when the imperative of sustainability intersects with the dynamics of global energy markets, understanding the economic impact of the energy sector becomes crucial, and the statement by former President Barack Obama encapsulates the urgent need to transition towards a sustainable energy future, one that harmonizes economic growth, energy security, and environmental preservation. As the world grapples with the pressing challenges of climate change, energy production and consumption dynamics have emerged as a pivotal force shaping our economic landscapes.\nIn this project, I aim to delve deeper into the economic impact of different energy sources, exploring the intricate relationship between energy prices, specifically crude oil, and natural gas, and their production and shedding light on the growing role of renewable energy and its impact on traditional energy markets. Additionally, investigating the relationship between energy prices and major economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), uncovering their ripple effects, if any, in the economy.\nBy meticulously analyzing data from various sectors, including historical energy prices, electricity costs, economic indicators, and renewable energy production, this project aims to uncover valuable insights that could inform policy decisions, business strategies, and future research endeavors.\n\n\nBefore diving into the intricate details, it is essential to understand the broader landscape. This project aims to link the price dynamics of crude oil and natural gas with their effects on the economy, providing a comprehensive analysis within the global context. Understanding this bigger picture is crucial for grasping the multi-layered relationships between the energy sector and economic development.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This blueprint represents the project’s scope.\n\n\nThis visual representation will serve as a guide through the thematic explorations of the project, setting the stage for a deep dive into the complex interplay between energy dynamics and economic indicators.\n\n\n\nTo navigate the complexities of how energy prices influence the U.S. economy, this project will dissect the data through multiple lenses, each offering a unique insight into the dynamics at play. The following analytical angles will structure our exploration:\n\n\nWe will examine the historical trends and volatility in crude oil and natural gas markets. Understanding these patterns is critical in comprehending how energy costs affect the broader economy and predicting future trends.\n\n\n\nA critical angle is the relationship between energy prices and primary economic indicators, like GDP and CPI. This perspective will allow us to measure the real impact of energy market fluctuations on financial health and consumer purchasing power.\n\n\n\nAs the energy sector evolves, so too does its economic impact. We’ll assess how the increasing presence of renewable energy in the national energy portfolio influences the traditional energy market and what that means for the future economy.\n\n\n\nDifferent sectors respond to energy price changes in various ways. We’ll delve into sector-specific data, mainly focusing on how underlying energy prices shape electricity costs for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors.\n\n\n\nEnergy policies can have a profound impact on prices and market stability. We will analyze the effects of past and present energy policies on market behavior and economic outcomes, offering insights into effective policy frameworks.\nEach of these angles will be explored through rigorous data analysis, employing time series methodologies to unpack the intricate relationship between energy markets and economic performance. By examining these perspectives, we aim to build a holistic understanding of the energy-economy nexus and provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interplay between energy market fluctuations and economic indicators is a focal point of numerous studies, shedding light on how changes in energy prices influence economic growth, inflation, and regional development. This section integrates existing literature that provides the backdrop for our exploration of energy price impacts on the U.S. economy, with a particular focus on studies from the United States and China.\nThe report by the Congressional Budget Office titled The Economic Effects of Recent Increases in Energy Prices examines the response of the U.S. economy to significant energy price shifts from 2004 to 2006. Despite notable increases in crude oil and natural gas prices, the report finds that the overall U.S. economy exhibited resilience, with moderate impacts on GDP, employment, and inflation. This resilience is attributed to robust economic conditions, effective monetary policies, and increased economic flexibility and stability over the years. This study provides a crucial understanding of how the U.S. economy adapts to energy price fluctuations, offering a valuable perspective for our analysis. The graph below from this report illustrates U.S. spending on petroleum as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), showing that, despite fluctuations in energy prices, the overall economic impact has been moderate. However, certain periods have seen significant spikes in energy spending relative to the nation’s economic output.\n\nIn contrast, Liping Wang’s study on The impact of energy price fluctuations on regional economic development based on a panel data model focuses on China, revealing the differential regional impacts of energy price changes on economic growth. Using data from 30 provinces and employing the FMOLS co-integration estimation method, Wang’s findings indicate that energy price variations, particularly in coal, electricity, and oil, have a tangible yet varying impact on China’s regional economies. The study underscores the significance of understanding regional disparities in energy price impacts, which could provide insightful comparisons for analyzing the U.S. context in our project.\nThese studies collectively enrich our investigation, offering comparative insights and methodological approaches to understanding the nuanced relationships between energy prices and economic indicators. By drawing on these studies, our project aims to dissect the specific dynamics within the U.S. energy market and its economic ramifications, enhancing our understanding and contributing to the broader discourse on energy economics.\n\n\n\nHere are the guiding questions that will guide the research by shedding light on the multifaceted nature of the relationship between the energy sector and the economy:\n\nHow have crude oil price fluctuations correlated with changes in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\nWhat trends can be identified in natural gas prices, and how have they historically impacted the cost of electricity for various consumer sectors?\nIn periods of significant oil price changes, how has the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reacted, particularly with respect to energy-intensive goods and services?\nHow do increases in natural gas prices affect the industrial sector’s energy expenses compared to the residential and commercial sectors?\nWhat is the relationship between crude oil prices and transportation sector electricity costs, and how does this relationship affect broader transportation industry economics?\nCan we identify a lag effect between changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and subsequent adjustments in electricity pricing across different sectors?\nTo what extent do variations in crude oil and natural gas prices explain the year-to-year variability in the U.S. inflation rate?\nHow have renewable energy production trends influenced the electricity pricing strategies of utility companies in the residential sector?\nDuring times of high volatility in energy prices, how resilient has the U.S. economy been in terms of maintaining growth and managing inflation?\nWhat patterns emerge when comparing the energy prices with the economic growth cycles, and what might this imply for future economic planning and energy policy?\n\n\n\n\n[1] Wang, L.
