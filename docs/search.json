For modeling the CPI time series, the log-transformed data is preferable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLag Plots\nLag plots are essential tools in time series analysis, offering insights into the temporal dependency within the data. By comparing data points with their previous values (lags), we can uncover patterns, trends, and potential autocorrelation in the series. Each lag in the plot helps us to visualize how past values relate to current values, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics and forecasting future trends. In this section, we explore lag plots for various key economic indicators and energy prices, providing a deeper understanding of their time-dependent structures.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nLag Plot\n#Create lag plot\ngglagplot(composite_crude_oil_ts, do.lines=FALSE) + \n  xlab(\"Lags\") + \n  ylab(\"Value (USD)\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Lag Plot for Refiner Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + \n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lag plots for the Cost of Crude Oil reveal a positive autocorrelation.

This breakdown provides a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and behaviors in the data. For instance, the trend component shows the long-term direction of the series, while the seasonal component highlights repeating patterns over fixed periods. The irregular component captures random fluctuations that are not part of the trend or seasonality. Here, we explore the decomposition plots for various key datasets, unveiling the distinct dynamics of each.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plot\n# Plot the decomposed ts\ndecomposed_crude_oil &lt;- ts_decompose(composite_crude_oil_ts, \"multiplicative\",showline = TRUE)\ndecomposed_crude_oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Cost of Crude Oil offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Shows an upward trend until 2008, with fluctuations until 2014, followed by a downward trend, illustrating the market’s long-term dynamics.\nSeasonal: Demonstrates annual seasonal patterns, highlighting how external factors influence oil prices.\nRemainder: The residuals are relatively stable around zero, suggesting a good model fit with some sporadic spikes in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plot\n#Plot the decomposed ts\ndecomposed_natural_gas &lt;- ts_decompose(citygate_gas_ts, \"multiplicative\",showline = TRUE)\ndecomposed_natural_gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decomposition plot for the Natural Gas Price offers a comprehensive view of the underlying patterns.\nTrend: Indicates a stable trend transitioning to volatility, reflecting the market’s evolving nature.\nSeasonal: Exhibits strong annual cycles, likely tied to demand changes with seasons\nRemainder: Spikes represent unexplained anomalies, possibly due to supply disruptions, especially around 2020.\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plot\n#Plot the decomposed ts\ndecomposed_electricity &lt;- ts_decompose(total_electricity_ts, \"multiplicative\",showline = TRUE)\ndecomposed_electricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity price decomposition highlights the stable growth and seasonality in the market.\nTrend: Shows a consistent rise, pointing to factors like inflation or cost increases in production affecting prices.\nSeasonal: A clear pattern suggests predictable consumption changes, possibly due to heating and cooling needs.\nRemainder: Minimal and stable residuals with occasional unexplained fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plot\n#Plot the decomposed ts\ndecomposed_gdp &lt;- ts_decompose(gdp_log_ts, \"multiplicative\",showline = TRUE)\ndecomposed_gdp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP decomposition provides insights into economic growth patterns.\nTrend: Reflects steady economic growth with some acceleration, illustrating the economy’s long-term health.\nSeasonal: Negligible seasonality\nRemainder: Notable deviations, like the spike around 2020, could indicate economic shocks, such as the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nDecomposition Plot\n#Plot the decomposed ts\ndecomposed_gdp &lt;- ts_decompose(cpi_log_ts, \"multiplicative\",showline = TRUE)\ndecomposed_gdp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CPI decomposition plot sheds light on inflation trends.\nTrend: The upward trend signifies ongoing inflation, a key economic indicator.\nSeasonal: Minimal seasonality.\nRemainder: Small residuals suggest the model captures CPI’s main trends, with occasional anomalies.\nFor all the data series examined, the decomposition plots provide a detailed confirmation of the preliminary insights highlighted in Part 1. These plots dissect the time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components, offering a more granular perspective that reinforces our initial analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF & PACF Plots\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are crucial tools in time series analysis, helping to identify the type of model that best describes a series. The ACF plot shows the correlation of the series with its own lags, providing insights into the overall correlation structure and potential seasonality. On the other hand, the PACF plot reveals the direct effect of past values on the current value, helping to pinpoint the order of autoregressive models.\nBy examining the ACF and PACF plots, we can discern patterns that suggest the presence of autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) components in our time series models. Significant spikes in the ACF plot indicate potential AR terms, while significant spikes in the PACF plot suggest MA terms. These plots also assist in determining the stationarity of the series, a crucial aspect in time series modeling, where non-stationary data often require differencing to achieve stationarity.\nIn this section, we’ll explore the ACF and PACF plots for our datasets delving into their autocorrelation structures and deriving insights that will inform our model selection and forecasting approach.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nACF-PACF Plot\n#ACF Plot for Crude Oil\ncrude_oil_acf &lt;- ggAcf(composite_crude_oil_ts) + \n  ggtitle(\"ACF Plot for Refiner Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_segment(lineend = \"butt\", color = \"#99494d\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#99494d\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#PACF Plot for Crude Oil\ncrude_oil_pacf &lt;- ggPacf(composite_crude_oil_ts) + \n  ggtitle(\"PACF Plot for Refiner Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_segment(lineend = \"butt\", color = \"#99494d\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#99494d\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Arrange the plots\ngrid.arrange(crude_oil_acf, crude_oil_pacf, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for crude oil prices demonstrates prolonged significant autocorrelation, suggesting a non-stationary series.

While detrending addresses the trend, differencing can help eliminate both trend and seasonality, making the series stationary.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nPlot\n#Plot the residuals\nplot1_crude_oil &lt;- autoplot(resid_crude_oil_ts, series=\"Detrended Crude Oil\", colour = \"#499995\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Detrended Crude Oil\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Differencing plot\nplot2_crude_oil &lt;- autoplot(diff(composite_crude_oil_ts), series = \"First Difference Crude Oil\", colour = \"#99494d\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Differences\") +\n  ggtitle(\"First Difference Crude Oil\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Arrange plots\ngrid.arrange(plot1_crude_oil, plot2_crude_oil, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrended:\nThe residuals after detrending indicate that linear detrending might not fully account for all underlying components, as patterns still emerge.\nFirst Difference:\nThe differenced series shows fluctuations around zero, indicative of improved stationarity.

By averaging the data over specific time windows, these methods filter out the ‘noise’ and offer a cleaner view of the direction in which the series is moving.\nIn our analysis, we employ moving averages as a means to discern and illustrate trends within the energy sector’s economic data. By choosing different window lengths for our moving averages, we can examine trends on various time scales:\nShort-Term Trends: A 5-period moving average (5-MA) can reveal insights into the short-term direction of the data, helping us to understand recent movements and immediate market responses.\nMedium-Term Trends: A 15-period moving average (15-MA) extends the horizon, smoothing out month-to-month volatility to focus on the quarterly or seasonal patterns.\nLong-Term Trends: With 20- and 30-period moving averages (20-MA and 30-MA), we delve into the long-term movements that reflect overarching trends and economic cycles.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nMA Plot\n#Ggplot\np &lt;- ggplot(crude_oil_df, aes(x = Date)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = Value, color = \"Actual Data\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma5, color = \"5-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma15, color = \"15-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma20, color = \"20-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma30, color = \"30-MA\")) +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + ylab(\"Value (USD)\") +\n  ggtitle('Crude Oil Price with Moving Averages') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Convert ggplot object to plotly\nplotly::ggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMA Plot\n#Ggplot\np_ng &lt;- ggplot(natural_gas_df, aes(x = Date)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = Value, color = \"Actual Data\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma5, color = \"5-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma15, color = \"15-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma20, color = \"20-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma30, color = \"30-MA\")) +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + ylab(\"Value (Price)\") +\n  ggtitle('Natural Gas Price with Moving Averages') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Convert ggplot object to plotly\nplotly::ggplotly(p_ng)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMA Plot\n#Ggplot\np_electricity &lt;- ggplot(total_electricity_prices, aes(x = Date)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = Value, color = \"Actual Data\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma5, color = \"5-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma15, color = \"15-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma20, color = \"20-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma30, color = \"30-MA\")) +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + ylab(\"Price (Cents per Kilowatthour)\") +\n  ggtitle('Electricity Price with Moving Averages') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Convert ggplot object to plotly\nplotly::ggplotly(p_electricity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMA Plot\n#Ggplot\np_gdp &lt;- ggplot(gdp_data, aes(x = DATE)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = LOG_GDP, color = \"Actual Data\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma5_log, color = \"5-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma15_log, color = \"15-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma20_log, color = \"20-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma30_log, color = \"30-MA\")) +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + ylab(\"GDP (in billions)\") +\n  ggtitle('GDP with Moving Averages of Log-Transformed Data') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n#Convert ggplot object to plotly\nplotly::ggplotly(p_gdp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMA Plot\n#Ggplot\np_cpi &lt;- ggplot(cpi_data, aes(x = DATE)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = LOG_CPI, color = \"Actual Data\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma5_log, color = \"5-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma15_log, color = \"15-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma20_log, color = \"20-MA\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = ma30_log, color = \"30-MA\")) +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + ylab(\"CPIAUCSL\") +\n  ggtitle('CPI with Moving Averages of Log-Transformed Data') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n        legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n#Convert ggplot object to plotly\nplotly::ggplotly(p_cpi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n← Previous Page: Data Viz\nNext Page: Univariate →\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are crucial tools in time series analysis, helping to identify the type of model that best describes a series. The ACF plot shows the correlation of the series with its own lags, providing insights into the overall correlation structure and potential seasonality. On the other hand, the PACF plot reveals the direct effect of past values on the current value, helping to pinpoint the order of autoregressive models.\nBy examining the ACF and PACF plots, we can discern patterns that suggest the presence of autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) components in our time series models. Significant spikes in the ACF plot indicate potential AR terms, while significant spikes in the PACF plot suggest MA terms. These plots also assist in determining the stationarity of the series, a crucial aspect in time series modeling, where non-stationary data often require differencing to achieve stationarity.\nThis section delves into the ACF and PACF plots for our datasets, examining their autocorrelation structures to get insights that will guide our model selection and inform our forecasting methodology.\n\nCrude OilNatural GasElectricityGDPCPI\n\n\n\n\nACF-PACF Plot\n#ACF Plot for Crude Oil\ncrude_oil_acf &lt;- ggAcf(composite_crude_oil_ts) + \n  ggtitle(\"ACF Plot for Refiner Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_segment(lineend = \"butt\", color = \"#99494d\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#99494d\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#PACF Plot for Crude Oil\ncrude_oil_pacf &lt;- ggPacf(composite_crude_oil_ts) + \n  ggtitle(\"PACF Plot for Refiner Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_segment(lineend = \"butt\", color = \"#99494d\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#99494d\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"))\n\n#Arrange the plots\ngrid.arrange(crude_oil_acf, crude_oil_pacf, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF plot for crude oil prices demonstrates prolonged significant autocorrelation, suggesting a non-stationary series.

    "text": "“To truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy.” – Barack Obama\nIn an era when the imperative of sustainability intersects with the dynamics of global energy markets, understanding the economic impact of the energy sector becomes crucial, and the statement by former President Barack Obama encapsulates the urgent need to transition towards a sustainable energy future, one that harmonizes economic growth, energy security, and environmental preservation. As the world grapples with the pressing challenges of climate change, energy production and consumption dynamics have emerged as a pivotal force shaping our economic landscapes.\nIn this project, I aim to delve deeper into the economic impact of different energy sources, exploring the intricate relationship between energy prices, specifically crude oil, and natural gas, and their production and shedding light on the growing role of renewable energy and its impact on traditional energy markets. Additionally, investigating the relationship between energy prices and major economic indicators such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), uncovering their ripple effects, if any, in the economy.\nBy meticulously analyzing data from various sectors, including historical energy prices, electricity costs, economic indicators, and renewable energy production, this project aims to uncover valuable insights that could inform policy decisions, business strategies, and future research endeavors.\n\n\nBefore diving into the intricate details, it is essential to understand the broader landscape. This project aims to link the price dynamics of crude oil and natural gas with their effects on the economy, providing a comprehensive analysis within the global context. Understanding this bigger picture is crucial for grasping the multi-layered relationships between the energy sector and economic development.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This blueprint represents the project’s scope.\n\n\nThis visual representation will serve as a guide through the thematic explorations of the project, setting the stage for a deep dive into the complex interplay between energy dynamics and economic indicators.\n\n\n\nTo navigate the complexities of how energy prices influence the U.S. economy, this project will dissect the data through multiple lenses, each offering a unique insight into the dynamics at play. The following analytical angles will structure our exploration:\n\n\nWe will examine the historical trends and volatility in crude oil and natural gas markets. Understanding these patterns is critical in comprehending how energy costs affect the broader economy and predicting future trends.\n\n\n\nA critical angle is the relationship between energy prices and primary economic indicators, like GDP and CPI. This perspective will allow us to measure the real impact of energy market fluctuations on financial health and consumer purchasing power.\n\n\n\nAs the energy sector evolves, so too does its economic impact. We’ll assess how the increasing presence of renewable energy in the national energy portfolio influences the traditional energy market and what that means for the future economy.\n\n\n\nDifferent sectors respond to energy price changes in various ways. We’ll delve into sector-specific data, mainly focusing on how underlying energy prices shape electricity costs for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors.\n\n\n\nEnergy policies can have a profound impact on prices and market stability. We will analyze the effects of past and present energy policies on market behavior and economic outcomes, offering insights into effective policy frameworks.\nEach of these angles will be explored through rigorous data analysis, employing time series methodologies to unpack the intricate relationship between energy markets and economic performance. By examining these perspectives, we aim to build a holistic understanding of the energy-economy nexus and provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interplay between energy market fluctuations and economic indicators is a focal point of numerous studies, shedding light on how changes in energy prices influence economic growth, inflation, and regional development. This section integrates existing literature that provides the backdrop for our exploration of energy price impacts on the U.S. economy, with a particular focus on studies from the United States and China.\nThe report by the Congressional Budget Office titled The Economic Effects of Recent Increases in Energy Prices examines the response of the U.S. economy to significant energy price shifts from 2004 to 2006. Despite notable increases in crude oil and natural gas prices, the report finds that the overall U.S. economy exhibited resilience, with moderate impacts on GDP, employment, and inflation. This resilience is attributed to robust economic conditions, effective monetary policies, and increased economic flexibility and stability over the years. This study provides a crucial understanding of how the U.S. economy adapts to energy price fluctuations, offering a valuable perspective for our analysis. The graph below from this report illustrates U.S. spending on petroleum as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), showing that, despite fluctuations in energy prices, the overall economic impact has been moderate. However, certain periods have seen significant spikes in energy spending relative to the nation’s economic output.\n\nIn contrast, Liping Wang’s study on The impact of energy price fluctuations on regional economic development based on a panel data model focuses on China, revealing the differential regional impacts of energy price changes on economic growth. Using data from 30 provinces and employing the FMOLS co-integration estimation method, Wang’s findings indicate that energy price variations, particularly in coal, electricity, and oil, have a tangible yet varying impact on China’s regional economies. The study underscores the significance of understanding regional disparities in energy price impacts, which could provide insightful comparisons for analyzing the U.S. context in our project.\nThese studies collectively enrich our investigation, offering comparative insights and methodological approaches to understanding the nuanced relationships between energy prices and economic indicators. By drawing on these studies, our project aims to dissect the specific dynamics within the U.S. energy market and its economic ramifications, enhancing our understanding and contributing to the broader discourse on energy economics.\n\n\n\nHere are the guiding questions that will guide the research by shedding light on the multifaceted nature of the relationship between the energy sector and the economy:\n\nHow have crude oil price fluctuations correlated with changes in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?\nWhat trends can be identified in natural gas prices, and how have they historically impacted the cost of electricity for various consumer sectors?\nIn periods of significant oil price changes, how has the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reacted, particularly with respect to energy-intensive goods and services?\nHow do increases in natural gas prices affect the industrial sector’s energy expenses compared to the residential and commercial sectors?\nWhat is the relationship between crude oil prices and transportation sector electricity costs, and how does this relationship affect broader transportation industry economics?\nCan we identify a lag effect between changes in crude oil and natural gas prices and subsequent adjustments in electricity pricing across different sectors?\nTo what extent do variations in crude oil and natural gas prices explain the year-to-year variability in the U.S. inflation rate?\nHow have renewable energy production trends influenced the electricity pricing strategies of utility companies in the residential sector?\nDuring times of high volatility in energy prices, how resilient has the U.S. economy been in terms of maintaining growth and managing inflation?\nWhat patterns emerge when comparing the energy prices with the economic growth cycles, and what might this imply for future economic planning and energy policy?\n\n\n\n\n[1] Wang, L.
