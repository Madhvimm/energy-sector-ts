# Revisiting Big Picture



The primary objective of this project was to investigate the economic impact of the energy sector, focusing on the relationship between energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and their production, as well as their influence on key economic indicators such as GDP and CPI. Additionally, the project aimed to explore the growing role of renewable energy and its impact on traditional energy markets.

To approach this goal, we employed a comprehensive set of time series analysis techniques and models, each offering unique insights into the dynamics at play. Our journey began with thorough data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which revealed the intricate patterns, trends, and characteristics of the time series data. This foundational understanding guided our subsequent modeling efforts.

We started with univariate time series models, such as ARIMA and SARIMA, to capture the temporal dependencies and forecast future values based on historical data. These models provided a baseline understanding of the individual time series and their future projections. We then extended our analysis to multivariate time series models, including ARIMAX/SARIMAX and VAR models, to capture the relationships and interactions between multiple time series variables. These models allowed us to understand how changes in one variable, such as energy prices, can influence other variables like GDP and CPI.


Given the project's focus on the energy sector, we also delved into financial time series models, specifically ARCH and GARCH models, to analyze the volatility of key energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation and Chevron Corporation. These models provided valuable insights into the risk and uncertainty associated with energy investments and their potential impact on the broader economy.


To further enhance our understanding, we embraced the power of deep learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These advanced models allowed us to capture complex non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies in the time series data, enabling more accurate forecasts and uncovering hidden patterns.



# Conclusion


Our findings suggest that energy prices, particularly crude oil and natural gas, have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The forecasts generated by our models indicate that fluctuations in energy prices can have ripple effects on GDP growth and consumer price inflation. Moreover, the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources is likely to reshape the traditional energy market dynamics, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the future economy.

The insights gained from this project have important implications for policymakers, businesses, and investors. Understanding the intricate relationship between energy prices and economic indicators can inform strategic decision-making, risk management, and policy formulation. By anticipating future trends and volatility in energy markets, stakeholders can make more informed choices to navigate the evolving energy landscape and drive sustainable economic growth.


In conclusion, this project has shed light on the complex interplay between the energy sector and the U.S. economy. By leveraging a diverse range of time series analysis techniques and models, we have unraveled the dynamics of energy prices, their impact on key economic indicators, and the emerging role of renewable energy. The findings emphasize the need for a holistic approach to energy policy, one that balances economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability. As we move forward, continued research and collaboration across disciplines will be crucial in shaping a resilient and prosperous energy future.
